Always-On-Top-PS-Script
=======================

A PowerShell script that lets you select an open window to give the always on top attribute.  Great for when you are watching a video and want to make sure that window doesn't get covered by other windows as you move windows around.

Known bugs:

--it seems that windows explorer still is not showing up some times
--and the two powershell things are getting mixed up..? (when I have ISE and a normal powershell console open)
